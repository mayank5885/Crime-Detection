## **Functioning of model**

### **Data reading**
1) **Reading Video**:
    `cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)`

2) **Skipping Few Frames**:
    `skip_frames_window = max(int(video_frames_count/SEQUENCE_LENGTH), 1)`

3) **Pre-processing steps**:
    - Resizes each frame to (64,64,3)
    - Normalize the resized frame by dividing it with 255 so that each pixel value then lies between 0 and 1
   
### **Data Pre-processing:**
  - As a crucial step in our workflow, preprocessing the video involves extracting individual frames and standardizing their dimensions for uniformity. By ensuring consistency in both height and length, we lay the foundation for accurate analysis and classification of video content.

  - Once standardized, the frames undergo classification labeling, where each frame is assigned a specific category based on its content. This classification step serves as a preliminary assessment, enabling us to organize and categorize the video frames according to the presence or absence of anomaly events.

  - By meticulously preprocessing the video data and labeling the frames, we establish a structured framework for subsequent analysis and model training. This systematic approach not only streamlines the data preparation process but also sets the stage for robust anomaly detection in CCTV videos

### **Model Structure for Crime Detection:**
**LRCN Model: Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network**

- In our quest to build a powerful deep learning model for anomaly detection in CCTV videos, we employ the innovative **Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) architecture**. This cutting-edge approach combines the strengths of **both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)**, specifically utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) units for effective temporal modeling.
  
- To implement our LRCN architecture, we will use time-distributed **`Conv2D`** layers which will be followed by **`MaxPooling2D`** and **`Dropout`** layers. The feature extracted from the **`Conv2D`** layers will be then flattened using the  **`Flatten`** layer and will be fed to a **`LSTM`** layer. The **`Dense`** layer with softmax activation will then use the output from the **`LSTM`** layer to predict the action being performed.

### **Model Training Approach**
1) Initializing **Early Stopping** for Preventing Overfitting
2) Our model is compiled using a **categorical cross-entropy loss function**, which is well-suited for multi-class classification tasks like anomaly detection. 
3) **Training Process Details**:
    - The training process spans across **70 epochs**, providing ample iterations for the model to learn from the training data. 
    - A **batch size of 14** is selected to balance computational efficiency and model stability. 
    - Additionally, **20% of the training data is reserved for validation purposes**, enabling us to assess the model's generalization capabilities during training.

### **Model Structure for Anomaly Classification**
We classified type of anomaly into these classes:

`categories_labels = {'Fighting': 0, 'Shoplifting': 1, 'Abuse': 2, 'Arrest': 3, 'Shooting': 4, 'Robbery': 5, 'Explosion': 6}`
- We combined both **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models** for image classification. The CNN extracts spatial features from images, while the LSTM processes temporal sequences.
-  These outputs are concatenated and passed through a final softmax layer for classification. The CNN comprises multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and dropout for feature extraction, while the LSTM includes two LSTM layers followed by a dense layer and dropout.
-  Finally, the models are combined, compiled, and trained using both CNN and LSTM inputs with corresponding callbacks for monitoring and logging training progress.
-  This method involves classifying images to identify anomalies and then creating a video comprised of these frames, where each frame is annotated with the type of anomaly detected.
